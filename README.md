# independence-day-project
A project to recognize the struggle for India's Independence. 

This was a fun project to celebrate India's Independence day on 15th August. I used face_recognition (https://pypi.org/project/face_recognition/) for recognizing faces in the webcam feed, used gTTS (https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/) for converting the text to speech and used pygame (https://www.pygame.org) to play the converted speech file. 

I used requests (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) to fetch Mahatma Gandhi's wikipedia description.
